--- REQUIREMENTS ---

1. When ran with no args, program prints numbered files
2. When ran with 1 arg, program prints out the corresponding file from noargs list
3. When ran with 2 args, program prints out corresponding file w/ cipher

--- PLANNED METHODS ---

void parseArgs(String args[]);

parseArgs will be directly passed args[] from main, check/validate args and then call appropriate programControl function


parseArgs pseudocode:

numArgs = args.length

if numArgs = 0
    programControl.printFiles(); (provided by member C)
else
    if numArgs > 2
        exit with too many args

    parse args[0] to integer "fileNumber"

    if fileNumber is not integer
        exit with invalid file number

    if no cipher provided (from numArgs check)
        programControl.printFile(fileNumber);

    if cipher provided (from numArgs check)
        String cipher = args[1]
        programControl.printFiles(fileNumber, cipher) // suggest an overloaded function here, B/C should validate cipher exists




void printText(String lines[]);

printText is a function to output lines of text, an array will be useful here so that file handler can just pass a string per file
we will expect the lines formatted, but this is just a good compartmentalization thing

printText pseudocode:

for String in lines:
    print String
