--- REQUIREMENTS ---

1. When ran with no args, program prints numbered files
2. When ran with 1 arg, program prints out the corresponding file from noargs list
3. When ran with 2 args, program prints out corresponding file w/ cipher

--- PLANNED METHODS ---

String parseArgs(String args[]);

parseArgs will be directly passed args[] from main, check/validate args and then call appropriate programControl function,
return a string to main which will be printed.


parseArgs pseudocode:

1. check if more than 2 args, exit if so
2. validate 1 arg to int, exit if not int
3. pass arguments to program Control, expect List of strings as return type
4. print strings received from program control



void printText(String lines[]);

printText is a function to output lines of text, an array will be useful here so that file handler can just pass a string per file
we will expect the lines formatted, but this is just a good compartmentalization thing

printText pseudocode:

for String in lines:
    print String


--- TESTING APPROACH ---

test parseArgs with different passed arrays of strings. we will use mockito to check that the appropriate function calls
are being made to programControl (or not).
inputs to test:
- 0 arg calls ProgramControl.getFile() with no arguments
- 1 arg (with valid int) calls ProgramControl.getFile() with 1 arg
- 1 arg (with invalid int) does not call ProgramControl.getFile()
- 2 arg (with valid int) calls ProgramControl.getFile() with 2 args
- 2 arg (with invalid int) does not call ProgramControl.getFile()
- more than 2 args does not call ProgramControl.getFile()
- both "03" and "3" will parse to int = 3.
