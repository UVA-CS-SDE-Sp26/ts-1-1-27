--- REQUIREMENTS ---

1. When ran with no args, program prints numbered files
2. When ran with 1 arg, program prints out the corresponding file from noargs list
3. When ran with 2 args, program prints out corresponding file w/ cipher

--- PLANNED METHODS ---

String parseArgs(String args[]);

parseArgs will be directly passed args[] from main, check/validate args and then call appropriate programControl function,
return a string to main which will be printed.


parseArgs pseudocode:

1. check if more than 2 args, exit if so
2. validate 1 arg to int, exit if not int or less than zero
3. pass arguments to program Control, expect List of strings as return type
4. print strings received from program control



--- TESTING APPROACH ---

test parseArgs with different passed arrays of strings. we will use mockito to check that the appropriate function calls
are being made to programControl (or not).
inputs to test:
- 0 arg calls ProgramControl.getFile() with no arguments
- 1 arg (with valid int) calls ProgramControl.getFile() with 1 arg
- 1 arg (with invalid int) does not call ProgramControl.getFile()
- 2 arg (with valid int) calls ProgramControl.getFile() with 2 args
- 2 arg (with invalid int) does not call ProgramControl.getFile()
- more than 2 args does not call ProgramControl.getFile()
- both "03" and "3" will parse to int = 3.
- negative / zero as file index
- float as file index
