--- REQUIREMENTS ---

1. Connect command line user interface to file handler
2. Request file contents from file handler when needed
3. Return readable text provided by file handler to user interface

--- METHODS ---

String getFile()

Given no arguments, this method will call the file handler method for an array of file names in order,
and return a string which lists each file name with a number

String getFile(int fileNumber)

Given one integer argument, this method will call the file handler method for an array of file names in order,
and then call the file handler method for the contents of the correct file. If there is no file matching the
index given, return an error string.

String getFile(int fileNumber, String cipher)

Given one integer argument and one string argument, this method will ignore the given cipher and perform
the same task as the above method using the given integer.

---------------TESTING DOCUMENTATION--------------------
1) For the UserInterface class, we used Mockito to verify if the correct ProgramControl methods were being
called in the correct cases.
2) For the ProgramControl class, we implemented a JUnit test to check the output in the case of no arguments
being provided. For the tests for one and two arguments, we used Mockito to verify if the correct FileHandler
methods were called in the correct cases.
3) For the FileHandler class, we used unit tests to check the output of each method based on given files.
