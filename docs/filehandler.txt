Requirements:
1. Look for a folder called 'data' either in the directory of the program or in the project folder.
2. When a request for a file is received, return the contents of the file. 
3. The function should take in the file name, along with a key. Without a second parameter, the program should use the default key.

Implementation:
1. File contents can be returned by using Linux commands like cat, storing and returning the contents in a string.
2. SHould just be a function that can be called by Team Member C's implementation, which will then implement the cipher part. 

Pseudocode:

keep the default key 

function findDataFolder():
    try data folder in the same directory the program is run from
    if "./data" exists and is a folder:
        return "./data"

    otherwise try the project folder (one level up)
    if "../data" exists and is a folder:
        return "../data"

    if neither exists, return ERROR


function getFileList():
    dataFolder = findDataFolder()
    if dataFolder is ERROR:
        return ERROR("data folder not found")

    return names of files inside data folder
    fileNames = list all file names inside dataFolder, this is returned to program control
    return fileNames


function getFileContents(fileName):
    overload that uses default key
    return getFileContents(fileName)


function getFileContents(fileName, key):
    dataFolder = findDataFolder()
    if dataFolder is ERROR:
        return ERROR("data folder not found")

    filePath = dataFolder + "/" + fileName
    if filePath does not exist:
        return ERROR
    contents = use some java function to turn the file into a string
    return contents

-----------------SOFTWARE DESIGN DOCUMENTATION-------------------
- The program is run through the TopSecret class with 0, 1, or 2 arguments being accepted
- The TopSecret class calls a static method of the UserInterface class which verifies the validity of the
input values and calls the correct ProgramControl method to request a string output
- The ProgramControl class determines whether to print a list of files or the contents of a requested file.
Both outputs require calling methods from FileHandler.
- The FileHandler class can return an array of strings corresponding to file names in 'data' and it can also return
the string content of a file requested by name.
- The ProgramControl class checks the numerical value of integer inputs and returns strings in the correct format
back to the UserInterface.
- The UserInterface ultimately returns the correct string that needs to be outputted back to TopSecret.
